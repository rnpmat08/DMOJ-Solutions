My solutions to DMOJ problems (10 points and under), written in C++ and Java. Files are named according to the problem codes on DMOJ. I may occasionally put some solutions to easier problems in Python. My code prioritizes simplicity and cleanliness, and only includes necessary input optimizations for Java. Java files just take up more space which messes up the ratio, but all solutions will have both C++ and Java.
