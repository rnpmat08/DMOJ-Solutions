My solutions to DMOJ problems (10 points and under), written in C++ and Java. Files are named according to the problem codes on DMOJ. My code prioritizes simplicity and cleanliness, and only includes necessary input optimizations for Java.
The reason why the Java to C++ ratio is 68:32 ish is because Java files just take up more space, all solutions will have both C++ and Java
